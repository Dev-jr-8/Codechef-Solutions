/*
Vilgax is an intergalactic alien warlord and conqueror. He is out on a quest to destroy all the planets in the Silky Way Galaxy. There are 100100 planets in the Silky Way Galaxy arranged in a straight line numbered from 11 to 100100. Vilgax sends NN monsters across planets to destroy them. Given an array AA of size NN, where A_iA 
i
â€‹
  denotes the initial planet where the i^{th}i 
th
  monster is located. The initial planets where monsters are located are already destroyed. Each monster can destroy PP planets in one hour. A monster can only travel in a straight line in any direction and will destroy all the planets in his path. A monster can travel only for HH hours after which it exhausts. Determine the number of safe planets that are not on the verge of destruction.
